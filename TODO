Features to implement:
    Perspective movement in place of absolute
    Clean up camera, remove unnecessary functions
    Optimize code for better framerates
    Mouse-controlled rotation
    Backface culling (does not work as is)
    Calculations to not render out of view range (the lack of this is causing several bad problems)

Bugs to fix:
    Framerate can drop to 25% when getting very close to block
    There are random points (literal points) at which the program will crash; the error was captured for review
